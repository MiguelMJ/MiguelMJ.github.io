# On technology

> The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.

I believe in the need for a responsible approach to the use of technology, firstly by those who legislate about it, secondly by those who build it, and finally by those who use it.

I believe that there is an urgent need for computer literacy for citizens and that the term *digital native* hides a very dangerous technological illiteracy.

I believe that the design of any technology that influences relevant aspects of life must be open and that the opposite is potentially malicious, probably dangerous and mostly irresponsible.

I believe there is a need to localise technology, reduce its high energy demands, eliminate any kind of planned obsolescence and encourage developers to think in terms of software and data preservation.
