There is a big difference in the look and feel of a 2D game with dynamic lighting and one without it. The bad thing is that, while 2D game development is relatively accessible, lighting algorithms are not as much.

Fortunately, we have amazing people in this world, like javidx9, that has [this amazing tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc3nnG2CG8U) on 2D shadow casting. It inspired me to write Candle. It is easy to integrate, it has no dependencies other than SFML itself and it's open for further development!

The code comes with a demo to test the main features, which are dynamic lights, fog and shadows.

Any feedback is appreciated! Thank you and have a nice day ;)
