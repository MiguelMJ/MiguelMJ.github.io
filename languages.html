<h2>On programming languages</h2>
<p>
    As programming languages theory is one of my main interests, I try to learn as much as I can about different languages and complete projects with them, to better understand their strengths and weaknesses. This way I intend to substantiate my own opinion on the design of programming languages. In this section I collect my experiences and opinions with different languages.

        <p>
            I started writing Bash scripts when I switched to Linux during my university period. My feelings towards Bash are complicated. In one hand, it is so convenient to work directly with processes, executables, files, output redirection... It's a shell language after all, and for some reason it's the default language in most common Linux consoles. However, its syntax feels hacky as hell. I have read one million times when to use <code>$*</code>, <code>$@</code>, <code>"$*"</code> and <code>"$@"</code> but I always need to check again. The same goes with <code><()</code> and <code><<<()</code>. Also, variable expansion is super useful but only with a cheatsheet at hand. Writing complex boolean conditions might become also confusing, as well as trying to work with arrays and dictionaries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In my opinion, Bash is not meant for use above certain level of complexity. The main use I give bash now is for creating master scripts (a purpose I used to give Makefile) but little else. I am hopeful that the community will start adopting some other more modern scripting language that maintains the features that make a shell language, but corrects the flaw of the obscure syntax and facilitates the use of data structures.
