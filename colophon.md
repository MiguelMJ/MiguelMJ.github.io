# Colophon

This is a personal webpage to organize and share my work and other activity; a professional curriculum, personal open source projects, learning materials, blog posts or anything else.

Most of the content of this website is in English, but the professional section and parts of the personal section are in Spanish only.

The site is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [jekyll-minifier](https://github.com/digitalsparky/jekyll-minifier) plugin with default settings to reduce file sizes. The code snippets use syntax highlight provided by [Rouge](https://rouge.jneen.net/) and a customized version of its base16.solarized.light theme. Math formulae are rendered using KaTeX by the [jekyll-katex](https://github.com/linjer/jekyll-katex/) plugin.

The font used is CMU Sans Serif, part of the CMU distribution of the [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern) font family by Donald Knuth. The font files are retreived from a copy kept in this very site and fall back to the system sans-serif font.

The [source code](https://github.com/MiguelMJ/miguelmj.github.io) of this site is hosted in GitHub and deployed on Netlify.

This website has had different iterations that have reflected my relationship with design and web technologies, culminating in the current version, which is guided more by a philosophy than a design style. Said philosophy partially combines [indieweb](https://indieweb.org) principles and [brutalist web design](https://brutalist-web.design/) and intends to align with a [deeper attitude towards technology](/reflections/on-technology). I have therefore opted for a static, content-focused design.
