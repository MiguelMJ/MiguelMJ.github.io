# MiguelMJ

*Knowledge only exists if it's shared*.
    
I make open source [projects](./projects) to learn, experiment with different techonologies and languages and, if possible, contribute to the community. Then, from time to time, I also like to write in a [blog](./blog) about things I learn. Sometimes I write about other [reflections](./reflections) too.

Here you'll learn [how to reach me](./social) online. However, if you want to report problems with my software, I usually respond faster through an issue in the repository itself.
    
You will also find my [*curriculum vitae*](/cv) in this site.

Most of the content of this website is in English, but the professional section and parts of the personal section are in Spanish only.
