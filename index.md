# MiguelMJ

*Knowledge only exists if it's shared*.
    
I make open source [projects](./projects) to learn, experiment with different technologies and languages and, if possible, contribute to the community. Then, from time to time, I write about software development and computer science in a [blog](./blog) and about other interests in the [Codex](./codex).

Here you'll learn [how to reach me](./social) online. However, if you want to report problems with my software, I usually respond faster through an issue in the repository itself.
    
You will also find my [*curriculum vitae*](/cv) in this site.

Most of the content of this website is in English, but the professional section and parts of the personal section are in Spanish only.
