# MiguelMJ

*Knowledge only exists if it's shared*.
    
I make open source [projects](./projects) to learn, experiment with different technologies and languages and, if possible, contribute to the community. Then, from time to time, I write about software development and computer science in a [blog](./blog) and about other interests in the [Codex](./codex).

Feel free to [reach me](./social) online! Just note that, for issues with my software, I usually respond faster through an issue in the repository.

Most of the content of this website is in English, but you might find some pages in Spanish.
