# Home

I'm a computer science graduate and programming is my passion. I work on open source projects and I write sometimes. *Knowledge only exists if it's shared*.

## What I do
    
I make open source [projects](./projects) to learn, experiment with different techonologies and languages and, if possible, contribute to the community. Then, from time to time I also like to write in a [blog](./blog) about things I learn. Sometimes I write about other issues outside of the blog, in the [personal](./personal) section (mostly in spanish).

## Contact me

In the [social](./social) section you'll find how to reach me online. If you want to report problems with my software, I usually respond faster through an issue in the repository itself.
    
## Professional experience
    
You will also find my [*curriculum vitae*](/cv) (also spanish) here.
