## Background
**JTASCHE** is the final form of one of my initial projects, so it has expressed a lot of my evolution as a programmer. My idea was to develop a tool similar to AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) or even better and that you could use to make text based applications wich require flexibility for the input, randomness on the output, modularity and extensibility.

The first version was called **MIOD** (Modular Input and Output Dialogue) and written completely from scratch. I learnt a lot about lexical and syntactic analysis on my own, but as a grew and discovered **Flex and Bison**, I created a second version called [**TASCHE**](www.github.com/MiguelMJ/TASCHE/) (Text Adventure Simple Chatbot Engine) - you can tell I was learning german those days. That was the first time I wrote a [wiki](www.github.com/MiguelMJ/TASCHE/wiki) as documentation, that you can still find both in english and spanish in the repository.

The idea of making higher level version using Java remained in my mind for some years until it finally knew the light and JTASCHE was born. That happened at the same time that I started my blog, so I began to write the series of its development, which you can read [in this site](/writing-a-conversational-user-interface.html) or in [dev.to](https://dev.to/miguelmj/series/8278).
