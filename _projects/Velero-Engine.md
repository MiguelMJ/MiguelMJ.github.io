## Background

Today there are two types of young developers: those who have been attracted at some point by video game development and those who will be. In my case, I started to learn Unity and C# one Chistmas and ended up discovering by summer that game development was not the only thing pulling me, but the design of the engine itself.

I know what they say about creating a game engine: either you are doing it to learn or your game have some needs that would be better satisfied by a custom engine. For me, the first one was enough to begin. I was already familiar with [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org/), which I would use as starting point, but from there, the architecture of the engine has suffered a lot of changes, through several years of learning, failing and restarting.

## Status

Currently, it is not finished, but the design is mostly definitive. I had to apply a lot of what they taught me in college about software development, and learn a lot on my own. This is the first personal project for which I designed a class diagram in UML, for which I use a proper build system (Make) and a documentation generator (doxygen). Also, this is the project that has taught me about real **OOP** in C++, the **SOLID principle**, linkage with **gcc** and methodic debugging with **gdb**.

I don't know if I will finish it soon, but I'm sure that it has already been worth it, just because of the experience gained in the process.
