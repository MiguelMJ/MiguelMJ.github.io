## Who I am

**My name is Miguel Mejía Jiménez and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Málaga, in Málaga, Spain**. The thing I love the most about programming is pushing the limits of my own skills and knowledge, so my main goal as a developer is to _learn from people that inspire me and do the same for others_.

## What I do

### As a developer

This is the **english version** of my website, where you will find my blog about programming and documentation about my projects, most of which you will find in GitHub. I mainly work with C++, SFML and GNU/Linux techonologies, but I like to keep some diversity and I'm currently focused on Java, R and front-end development.

### As a teacher

I give private lessons of secondary level mathematics, mathematics for entrance examinations (PAU) and programming in C, C++ and Java.

If you speak spanish and are interested in receiving classes, you will find more information in the [spanish version](es) of this site.

## Want to talk?
