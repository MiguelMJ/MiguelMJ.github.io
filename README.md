This is a personal webpage to organize and share my work and other activity; a professional curriculum, personal open source projects, learning materials, blog posts or anything else.

This website has had different iterations that have reflected my relationship with design and web technologies, culminating in the current version, which is guided more by a philosophy than a design style. Said philosophy combines [indieweb](https://indieweb.org) principles and [brutalist web design](https://brutalist-web.design/) and intends to align with a deeper attitude towards technology that advocates the need for [free open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/Principles/). I have therefore opted for a static, content-focused design.

The site is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [jekyll-minifier](https://github.com/digitalsparky/jekyll-minifier) plugin with default settings.

The font used is CMU Sans Serif, part of the CMU distribution of the [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern) font family by Donald Knuth. The font files are retreived from a copy kept in this very site and fall back to the system sans-serif font.

The source code of this site is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/MiguelMJ/miguelmj.github.io) and deployed on GitHub Pages.
