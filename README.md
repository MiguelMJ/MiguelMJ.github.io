## My personal website

Have you come to see the source code of my website? It's not much, just an ordinary Jekyll site, like countless portfolios out there. I guess you are a curious person if you came here. As a reward I'll tell you one thing: not all the content of my site is directly accessible from the main page, some of it I've hidden as **easter eggs**.

Obviously, being open source, you can look directly into the files of the page (what you probably came here to do) and find it all... but the truth is that very few of you usually do things like that. I'll save you the trouble of digging through my questionable code: here is the list of all the easter eggs hidden in my web page:

üêáü•ö
<ul>
<li><details>
<summary>README</summary>

If you type  <kbd>r</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>m</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> in homepage you'll be automatically redirected here.
</details></li>
<li><details>
<summary>Hidden blog</summary>
If you click at least 5 times anywhere in the <b>Highlighted articles</b> section (for example closing and opening it) a misterious goat will appear to guide you to a secret blog (<i>only in spanish for now!</i>).

You can skip the goat step if you just type  <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd> in the homepage
</details></li>
<li><details>
<summary>On programming languages</summary>
If you higlight the word "languages" anywhere on the site (like the <b>Higlighted projects</b> description) you will be automatically redirected to a hidden page titled <b>On programming languages</b>.
</details></li>
<li><details>
<summary>Select font</summary>
If you hold down the left mouse button for several seconds on the light bulb icon to change the theme, a selector to change the page font will open instead.</b>.
